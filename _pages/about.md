I'm a second year undergraduate student from [School of Economics](https://www.econ.sdu.edu.cn/), [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes quantitative history, machine learning, and natural language processing.

You can find my CV here: [LinZehao's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/vitae.pdf).

## EDUCATION

**Shandong University(SDU)**, Jinan, Shangdong, China ----------------2022-Present  
Master student in Economics, expected June 2025  
Avearge marks: 91.43 / 100  

**Anhui University(AHU)**, Hefei, Anhui, China -----------------------2018-2022  
B.S. in Economis  
Avearge marks: 90.07 / 100  

## RESEARCH INTERESTS

I've developed a interest in the Quantitative History and Natural Language Processing(NLP)

## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
**Air pollution, sentiment and traffic accidents** --------------Jan. 2024 – Present  
Using Lexicon-based approach approach with 190 million tweet data, we construct daily public sentiment value at the county level in Japan from 2017-2022. Then we combine the public sentiment value with air pollution data to see if air pollution affect public sentiment. We use wind-blown external pollutants as instrument to alleviate the endogeneity problem. The results showed that air pollution increased negative public emotions, especially anger and anxiety, and indirectly led to an increase in local traffic deaths.

**[Income and expenditure of different classes in the Republic of China in the 1930s](../assets/20世纪二三十年代民国城市各阶层收支状况分析.pdf)**  ---------  
Jul. 2021 –Jun. 2022  
I collect and present data on the income and expenditure of the upper classes, such as senior officials and wealthy businessmen, to the lower classes, such as stevedore and beggars, in the Republic of China in the 1930s, providing some evidence to understand the inequality of the time.  

**[Has the epidemic forced the upgrading of industrial structure?](../assets/疫情是否倒逼了产业结构升级？——基于PSM-DID方法的实证.pdf)** --------Aug. 2020 – Apr. 2021  
According to the regional variation of the SARS epidemic impact in 2003, I constructed a PSM-DID model to identify the relationship between the epidemic and the upgrading of industrial structure, and explored the influencing mechanism.
