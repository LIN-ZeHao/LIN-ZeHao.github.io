I'm a second year undergraduate student from [School of Economics](https://www.econ.sdu.edu.cn/), [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes quantitative history, machine learning, and natural language processing.

You can find my CV here: [LinZehao's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/curriculum_vitae.pdf).

## EDUCATION

**Shandong University(SDU)**, Jinan, Shangdong, China ----------------2022-Present  
Master student in Economics, expected June 2025  
Avearge marks: 91.43 / 100  

**Anhui University(AHU)**, Hefei, Anhui, China -----------------------2018-2022  
B.S. in Economis

## RESEARCH INTERESTS

I've developed a interest in the Quantitative History and Natural Language Processing(NLP)

## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
**The Impact of Air Pollution on Human Sentiments** --------------Jan. 2024 – Present  
Using Lexicon-based approach and Machine Learning-based approach with 190 million tweet data, I construct daily public sentiment value at the county level in Japan from 2017-2022. Then we combine the public sentiment value with air pollution data to see if air pollution affect public sentiment. 

**Procedural justice and preference of redistribution** --------------Dec. 2023 – Present  
I use word embedding techniques to measure the preference of redistribution in different countries. Then I look at whether millionaires’ wealth is perceived to be just in those countries by looking at their backgrounds and industries. This paper mainly examines the causal relationship between procedural justice and preference of redistribution.  

**Income and expenditure of different classes in the Republic of China in the 1930s**  ---------  
Jul. 2021 –Jun. 2022  
I collect and present data on the income and expenditure of the upper classes, such as senior officials and wealthy businessmen, to the lower classes, such as stevedore and beggars, in the Republic of China in the 1930s, providing some evidence to understand the inequality of the time.  

**Has the epidemic forced the upgrading of industrial structure?** --------Aug. 2020 – Apr. 2021  
According to the regional variation of the SARS epidemic impact in 2003, I constructed a PSM-DID model to identify the relationship between the epidemic and the upgrading of industrial structure, and explored the influencing mechanism.
